# PluginManager
Plugin manager library using Qt framework to create Qt applications based on custom loadable plugins.
 
The Example app main.cpp has to be updated in order to load the .json file.
Path is currently hard coded.

Plugins have to be compiled independently since there is no dependency between them and the ExampleApp.
